### Python BMI Calculator: Internship Project Overview

**Project Title**: BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator in Python

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project is to develop a simple Python application that calculates and categorizes a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their input weight and height. This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as functions, user input handling, and conditional statements.

**Key Features**:
1. **User Input**: Accepts weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) from the user.
2. **BMI Calculation**: Uses the formula \( BMI = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2} \) to calculate the BMI.
3. **BMI Categorization**: Categorizes the BMI result into various categories: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensures that the user inputs valid numerical values and handles edge cases like non-positive values or invalid input types.

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- **Basic Python Syntax**: Functions, conditionals, and loops.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Working with formulas to calculate BMI.
- **User Interaction**: Accepting and processing user input.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring robustness in user input (e.g., invalid values).

**Outcome**:  
The project provides hands-on experience in Python programming, focusing on data collection, validation, and applying logic to real-world problems. It helps interns develop a solid understanding of working with basic Python features and preparing simple applications for practical use.

**Technologies Used**:  
- Python 3.x
- Command-line interface (CLI)

This project serves as a beginner-friendly tool for interns to understand essential Python concepts and create a practical application while working with user input and logic.
